## Audio Signal Processing

This is a small project processing sound (e.g., human voice) using DFT, Pre-emphasis, and LPC. The script is written in R (for detail, please check [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)). An audio processing package [tuneR](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tuneR/index.html) is used to read the .wav file, however, the core algorithm, DFT, Pre-emphasis, and LPC are implemented in this project from scratch.
